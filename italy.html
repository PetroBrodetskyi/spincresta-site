              <h3>Online Gambling in Italy</h3>
              <p>
                Online gambling in Italy is fully legal and strictly regulated. Italian players have access to
                a wide range of ADM-licensed online casinos, sportsbooks, poker rooms and bingo sites. The
                market is one of the most mature in Europe, with strong focus on player protection and fair
                play.

              <p>
                The Agenzia delle Dogane e dei Monopoli (ADM) oversees all gambling activities in Italy.
                Licensed operators must meet strict standards on fairness, security, AML/CFT and responsible
                gambling. Many platforms also hold MGA licenses for added trust and EU compliance.

              <p>
                Italian players enjoy slots, roulette, blackjack, live dealer tables and poker. Sports betting
                focuses on calcio (Serie A, Coppa Italia, international tournaments), horse racing (Derby
                Italiano), tennis, motorsports (Formula 1) and basketball. Live in-play betting and cash-out
                are widely available.
