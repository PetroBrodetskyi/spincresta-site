          <h2>Online Gambling in France: Legal Framework</h2>
          <p>
            Online gambling in France is strictly regulated. While online casino games such as slots,
            roulette, and blackjack are prohibited, online sports betting, horse race betting, and poker are
            legal and regulated by the Autorité Nationale des Jeux (ANJ).
          </p>

          <h2>Licensing and Player Protection</h2>
          <p>
            All legal online gambling platforms in France must hold a valid ANJ license. Licensed operators
            are required to comply with strict rules regarding player identification, data protection, and
            financial transparency. This regulatory oversight ensures a secure and fair gambling environment
            for French players.
          </p>

          <h2>Available Games and Betting Options</h2>
          <p>
            French players can legally access sports betting markets covering football, tennis, basketball,
            and more, as well as online poker rooms and horse race betting platforms. Game fairness and payout
            rates are closely monitored by the regulator.
          </p>

          <h2>Bonuses and Promotions</h2>
          <p>
            Licensed French operators offer welcome bonuses and promotional offers within strict regulatory
            limits. All bonus terms, wagering requirements, and conditions must be clearly displayed to ensure
            transparency and informed player decisions.
          </p>

          <h2>Mobile Gambling in France</h2>
          <p>
            Most licensed platforms in France provide optimized mobile websites and apps, allowing players to
            place bets and play poker seamlessly on smartphones and tablets.
          </p>

          <h2>Responsible Gambling</h2>
          <p>
            Responsible gambling is a core requirement under French law. Licensed platforms must provide tools
            such as deposit limits, self-exclusion options, and access to national support organizations to
            help players maintain control over their gambling activity.
          </p>

          <p>
            By choosing licensed online gambling platforms in France, players ensure a secure experience that
            complies fully with national regulations and player protection standards.
