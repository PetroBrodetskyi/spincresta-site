              <h3>Online Gambling in Greece</h3>
              <p>
                Online gambling in Greece is fully legal and regulated since the 2011 Gambling Law (updated
                2020s). Greek players enjoy a safe, licensed market offering real-money slots, live dealer
                games, poker and extensive sports betting - especially football.
              </p>

              <h3>Regulation and Licensing in Greece</h3>
              <p>
                The Hellenic Gaming Commission (HGC / ΕΕΕΠ) oversees online gambling. Licensed operators must
                comply with strict standards on fairness, player protection, AML/CFT and responsible gambling.
                Choosing an HGC-licensed platform ensures legal protection and high safety standards.

              <p>
                Greek players favor slots, roulette, blackjack, live dealer tables and poker. Sports betting
                focuses on football (Super League Greece, Greek Cup, UEFA competitions), basketball and
                volleyball. Live in-play betting and cash-out are widely available.
