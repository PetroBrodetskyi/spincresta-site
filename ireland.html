          <h2>Online Gambling in Ireland</h2>
          <p>
            Online gambling in Ireland is legal and widely available. Irish players can access online casinos,
            sports betting sites, poker rooms, and other real-money gambling platforms operated by licensed
            providers.
          </p>

          <h2>Regulation and Licensing</h2>
          <p>
            The Irish gambling market is regulated by the Gambling Regulatory Authority of Ireland (GRAI).
            Licensed operators must comply with strict requirements related to player protection, financial
            transparency, and responsible gambling. Many trusted platforms also operate under recognized EU
            licenses, such as those issued in Malta.
          </p>

          <h2>Casino Games and Betting Options</h2>
          <p>
            Irish players can enjoy a wide range of online casino games, including slots, roulette, blackjack,
            live dealer games, and poker. Sports betting is particularly popular, with extensive markets
            covering football, horse racing, rugby, golf, and more.
          </p>

          <h2>Bonuses and Promotions</h2>
          <p>
            Online casinos and betting sites in Ireland offer welcome bonuses, free bets, free spins, cashback
            deals, and ongoing promotions. Bonus terms and wagering requirements are clearly stated to ensure
            transparency.
          </p>

          <h2>Mobile Gambling in Ireland</h2>
          <p>
            Most licensed gambling platforms are fully optimized for mobile devices. Players can access casino
            games and place bets via mobile browsers or dedicated apps on both iOS and Android.
          </p>

          <h2>Responsible Gambling</h2>
          <p>
            Responsible gambling is a key focus in Ireland. Licensed platforms provide tools such as deposit
            limits, time-outs, self-exclusion options, and access to support organizations to help players
            maintain control over their gambling activity.
          </p>

          <p>
            By choosing licensed and trusted online casinos and betting sites in Ireland, players can enjoy a
            safe, fair, and regulated gambling experience.
